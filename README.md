Ultimate Frisbee Game Analyzer

Hello! This is the directory for an ultimate frisbee analysis, I am creating this for C++ practice as well as retrieving information from my college team's games.

The goal is to input raw data of a game, the program should compile all the information and output how everyone did in each half, how the team did aganist certain defenses, and what success rates for different aspects of the game. 

# Documentation
Documentation for creating raw data and running the program will be located here.
